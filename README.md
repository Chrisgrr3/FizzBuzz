This simple Java program determines whether an inputted number is divisible by 3, 5, both, or neither. If the number is divisible by 3 and not 5, then the output will be "Fizz".
If the number is divisible by 5 and not 3, then the output will be "Buzz".
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then the output will be "FizzBuzz".
If the number is neither divisible by 3 or 5, then the output will simply be the inputted number as a string.
